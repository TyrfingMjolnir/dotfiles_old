# Purchase requirement

To reach a sustainable environment we find it important to be able to avoid certain synthetics, and choose natural above artificial.

## Stop list

* Composites, plastics and other synthetics; anything that becomes microplastics sooner or later.
* Plastic shopping bags, including redonkolous hemp or fiber immitations.

## Go list

* Any kind of straws, wood or cannabis
* Metal, the more precious the better, however cast iron will do over plastic in most cases.
* Sap from a tree

## Challenges

* Whereas most computers are made of metal, most keyboards are made from plastic.
