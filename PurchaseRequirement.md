# SOP Purchase

To reach a sustainable environment we find it important to be able to avoid certain synthetics, and choose natural above artificial.

## Stop list

* Composites, plastics and other synthetics; anything that becomes microplastics sooner or later.
* Plastic shopping bags, including redonkolous hemp or fiber immitations.

## Go list

* Any kind of straws, wood or cannabis in particular for furniture, rope works, computer and vehicle body parts.
* Metal, the more precious the better, however cast iron will do over plastic in most cases.
* Sap from a tree

### Go list specific considerations

#### Hardware estimated TCO and endurance
* Das Keyboard BADASS 4; due to overall build quality
* Most computers by Apple have way more metal than plastic in the chassis, the same goes for Talosâ„¢ II by Raptor
* For tarp choose old fashion, rather than new lightweight( next year micro plastic )

#### Catering
* Alufoil over plastic when catering.
* Require real utensils, demand there be no plastic.

## Challenges

* Whereas most industrial grade computers are made from metal, most keyboards are made from plastic.
